# Open School Library Lite
The Open School Library Lite is the name of the free software written to accommodate small to medium sized libraries. It was designed by students in a Greek school named “Evangeliki Scholi Smyrna”. It was primarily designed by students, for students in order to increase accessibility for small libraries that might not be able to rent or buy expensive infasturctures to host more complex services, or get a subscription to an online service, or have the technical knowledge to use one of them.


# Installing Open School Library Lite
You will need two things in order to install this service. Firstly you will need a server to host your service. The server does not have to be a very powerful one, a very basic will also work. Secondly you will need to install MySQL or MariaDB, Apache(2) and PHP. There are countless guides on how to install these three programs for your OS (Operating System). After that, navigate to your default server folder (The location will be mentioned by the tutorial to install Apache(2)) and place the source folders inside. After that navigate with the help of your browser of choice to “localhost”. Finally, fill out some inputs to configure the service (The whole configuring process takes less than one minute).
